```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here, we'll practice creating some interactive graphs and tables using built-in datasets in R packages.

- Interactive plots: {plotly}
- Interactive tables: {DT}

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Attach packages:
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(DT)

```

### A. Interactive graph of iris dimensions

Using Edgar Anderson's famous 'iris' dataset. Data set already exists in R so we don't need to read it in.
```{r, echo = FALSE}

iris_graph <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Sepal.Width,
                 color = Species),
             alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Petal Width (cm)",
       y = "Petal Length (cm)",
       title = "My iris graph")

# iris_graph

# Adding interactivity feature
ggplotly(iris_graph)

```
